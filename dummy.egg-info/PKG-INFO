        Introduction
        ------------
        
        This project is an attempt at documenting Python code and prepare a ready-to-release Python package, including proper tests and documentations. The ultimate goal of this project is to release a Python package of John A. Marohn (jam99@cornell.edu) onto GitHub and PyPI.
        
        The dummy package
        -----------------
        
        This package is literally a dummy package. All it does is adding or subtracting two given numbers and give out a result.
