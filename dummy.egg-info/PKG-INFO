        Introduction
        ------------
        
        This project is an attempt at documenting Python code and prepare a ready-to-
        release Python package, including proper tests and documentations. The ultimate 
        goal of this project is to release a Python package of John A. Marohn 
        (jam99@cornell.edu) onto GitHub and PyPI.

        The dummy package
        -----------------
        
        This package is literally a dummy package. All it does is adding or subtracting 
        two given numbers and give out a result.

        Quickstart:
        -----------
        
        + At the root document, run ``python setup.py install``.
        + Test the module with ``python setup.py test``.
        + Calling module:
        	- ``import dummy``
        	- ``result1 = dummy.calc(n1,op,n2)``
        	- ``result2 = dummy.calc(n1,op,n2)``
        	with n1,n2 are numbers, op are operation in string '+','-','*','.' and 'x'
